Workflow to-do\'s
-----------------

### Tic-tac-toe

1.  **TODO** make basic vis for 2d TTT, use blocks instead of
    html, think about vis for other games and how to optimize

2.  make symmetries for tic-tac-toe within \`background.lp\` if possible

### Minimax algorithm

1.  **TODO** check if possible to use reverse level iterator
    without list conversion, perhaps as generator

### Presentation

1.  add consistent pydocstrings/spaces and improve readmes

### Long-term goals

1.  build efficient mini-max algorithm and integrate alpha-beta pruning

2.  integrate this approach with asp/ilasp to provide bravely ordered
    samples for complex games
