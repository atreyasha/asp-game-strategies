## Changelog

### ASP minimax
* use asp to efficiently create minimax tree
* bravely order learned examples and channel to `ILASP` for learning weak constraints

### Python minimax
* write python-based script for minimax tree creation
* extend to nim and tic-tac-toe

### Monte-carlo tree search
* work on writing quick tree search algorithm to assist in learning examples
* extend this with parallelization

### Visualization
* make pretty visualizations for game trees

### Comparisons
* make comprehensive temporal comparisons for running algorithms with asp vs. python
* compute time complexities of various techniques
* compare best methods given pre-processing times, post-processing times and online processing
