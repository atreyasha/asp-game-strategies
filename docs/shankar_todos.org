** Workflow to-do's

*** Urgent
***** TODO add all functions and tests directly into main.py 
***** TODO after cleaning up document -> work on actual cleaning code process
***** TODO put all game backgrounds in single location which get referenced -> make simplest possible configuration for repository
***** TODO make document with all goals and objectives visualized
***** TODO transfer issues from Gitlab to GitHub
***** TODO add better documentation to show functionalities with table
***** make nicer visualizations with more symmetric faces

*** Minimax algorithm
***** TODO extend game to nim
***** check if possible to use reverse level iterator without list conversion

*** Monte-carlo tree search
***** investigate theory and implement in code to approximate minimax tree
***** show that minimax and monte-carlo trees converge in practice

*** Optimizations
***** add parallelization to all scripts, linear time reduction
***** add further symmetries to reduce search space; extra overhead to search for level-symmetries
***** time gained in linear symmetry searched, time saved in greater than linear reduced number of leaves due to branching factor
      
*** Presentation
***** TODO once done, make modular and separate classes for compacter representation
***** TODO add script to convert into state-wise tree with pretty ansi for easier visualization of some branches
***** TODO possibly merge visualization into single tree pipeline for less overhead, reduce overall tree visits
***** publish separate repository for minimax/monte-carlo game approach using python and later pipe into asp framework, resume visualization techniques later on and see how monte carlo approach can work, try abstracting to nim
***** save graphs as images, dotfiles and pickles to binary which can be used later

*** Long-term goals
***** build efficient mini-max algorithm and integrate alpha-beta pruning
***** integrate monte-carlo tree search to auto-generate good and bad examples for ilasp
***** show that monte-carlo approach can approximate minimax tree
***** integrate this approach with asp/ilasp to provide bravely ordered samples for complex games
