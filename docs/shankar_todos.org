** Workflow to-do's


*** Presentation
***** TODO make html table-like grids for more symmetric game visualizations
***** TODO add specific minimax and tree creation functions into base readme
***** TODO add dedicated modular html conversion functions while keeping old ascii functions intact
***** save graphs as images, dotfiles and pickles to binary which can be used later

*** Monte-carlo tree search
***** TODO investigate theory and implement in code to approximate minimax tree given certain time threshold
***** show that minimax and monte-carlo trees converge in practice, perhaps for smaller trees

*** Minimax algorithm
***** TODO add pydocstrings to all tree bits
***** TODO review pull request which might require editing of full_time.lp encodings
***** check if possible to use reverse level iterator without list conversion

*** Optimizations
***** TODO optimize mini-max algorithm with fewer tree visits where possible, might need to look into exact source code within step/state
***** add parallelization to all scripts, linear time reduction
      
*** Extra: game encodings
***** possible to terminate nim even one step earlier with next has
***** add asp encodings for tic-tac-toe, add ability to read more diverse encodings

*** Long-term goals
***** build efficient mini-max algorithm and integrate alpha-beta pruning
***** integrate monte-carlo tree search to auto-generate good and bad examples for ilasp
***** show that monte-carlo approach can approximate minimax tree
***** integrate this approach with asp/ilasp to provide bravely ordered samples for complex games
