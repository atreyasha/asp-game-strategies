** Workflow to-do's

*** Tic-tac-toe
***** TODO make basic vis for 2d TTT, use blocks instead of html, think about vis for other games and how to optimize
***** make symmetries for tic-tac-toe within `background.lp` if possible

*** Minimax algorithm
***** TODO check if possible to use reverse level iterator without list conversion, perhaps as generator
     
*** Presentation
***** add consistent pydocstrings/spaces and improve readmes

*** Long-term goals
***** build efficient mini-max algorithm and integrate alpha-beta pruning
***** integrate this approach with asp/ilasp to provide bravely ordered samples for complex games
